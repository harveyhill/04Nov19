            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p class="indent">For this project, we were tasked with creating an Entity Relationship Diagram based on a hospital. In my solution,I came up with 10 entities, the main ones being patient, doctor, location, and supplier. The patient has one to many relationship with bed/room, a one to many relationship with insurance, and a many to many relationship with doctor. A junction object was created between patient and doctor containing the treatment information. The doctor also has a many to many relationship with location, with a junction object called schedule which details the emloyees shifts. Employee has a simlar relationship with location. The location then has a one to many relationship with inventory which has a one to many ralationship with supplier. Sample fields were included for each object but obviously these are not very extensive.</p>
