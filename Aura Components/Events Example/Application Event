<!-- We declare an event, of the application type. 
	 Application events broadcast to the entire app, allowing any component to handle it.
	 Component events only broadcast to those in direct hierarchy with it, so it is more limited in scope.
	 Best practice is to use component events unless we absolutely must use an Application event. -->
<aura:event type="APPLICATION" description="Event template">
    <!-- We declare an attribute in order to carry information inside the event. -->
    <aura:attribute name="Bob" type="String" />
